Coinbase Trading of Cryptos

This is a weekend project to use the Coinbase Pro API to download the available Crypto data and to analyze them in terms of buy or sell indicators.

You can use it but it is not a financial advisor ! There is a high risk that you will lose money !

It is a weekend project to analyze the data.

Feel free to use parts of your own.

I prefer analysis in R. Most people use python for APIs, so we make the analysis in R and use python for the trading bot and API.


Feel free to contribue since this is my first project using GIT or github.
